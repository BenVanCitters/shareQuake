# shareQuake
quake has always been about giving; not receiving.

In this mod all you can do is distribute your inventory.  When you fire your weapon instead of unleashing dangerous violence it will dispense a portion of your ammo, your armor, or your health so that it is easier to share with other players.  There is no longer any ways to directly harm other players or monsters.
